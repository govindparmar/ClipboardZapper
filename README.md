# ClipboardZapper
Automatically censors certain phrases copied on the clipboard with a different character.
                                                                 
For example, if this program is configured to censor the phrase "SUPERSECRETPASSWORD123", and the user on the workstation copied the text "my password is SUPERSECRETPASSWORD123", when they pasted the content of the clipboard, it would be "my password is **********************"
